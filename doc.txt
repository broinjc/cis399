1. In this install, we'll be using Debian. Download the "i386" image from http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst
2. Burn the downloaded .iso file onto a CD using any CD-burning program.
3. Turn on the computer, insert the CD into the CD drive, and restart the computer. (If it does not automatically boot into the Debian install process, ensure your computer's BIOS primary boot device is set to CD)

From here you can use arrow keys and tab to move around.

4. At the first screen press enter to start the installation process without a graphical interface
5. At the language screen press enter again for English
6. Press enter on the territory screen for United States (Alternatively use the arrow keys to select another option)
7. Keymap = english

The install will then load components and configure itself.

It will attempt to configure the network, if you are not plugged in you can choose to configure it later
Continue and "Do not configure the network at this time"

Next you will be prompted to enter a hostname for the computer.

Then you'll set up root and normal user account names and passwords.
